# COVID-19-Data-Visualization-Project

## Project Overview
###### Leveraged python and its packages to visualize the impact of COVID-19 on various countries across the world and the vaccines administered across the world.
###### Also visualized the impact of COVID-19 across Canadian provinces.
- Used pandas to explore and manipulate variables in the dataset to prepare for creating visuals.
- Used seaborn to create simple plots.
- Used matplotlib to format the seaborn plots and their axis.
- Used plotly and its modules to create interactive visuals.
- Interactive plotly plots don't show in the covid19 notebook on GitHub but I have posted snapshots in the Visualizations folder.
